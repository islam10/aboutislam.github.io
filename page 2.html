<font color="red">ISLAM</font>

<h2>Islam, major world religion spreaded by the Prophet Muhammad(he was told by ALLAH to spread the religion) in Arabia in the 7th century CE. The Arabic term islām, means the fundamental religious idea of Islam—that the believer accepts surrender to the will of Allah (in Arabic, Allāh: God). Allah is viewed as the sole God—creator, sustainer, and restorer of the world. The will of Allah, to which human beings must submit, is made known through the sacred scriptures, the Qurʾān (often spelled Koran in English), which Allah revealed to his messenger, Muhammad. In Islam Muhammad is considered the last of a series of prophets (including Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Dawud, and Issa), and his message simultaneously consummates and completes the attributed to earlier prophets.</h2>

<h2>The basic belief of Islam is that there is only one God, Allah, who is the sole and sovereign ruler of the universe. Allah has made himself known through other prophets at other times; but his best and final revelation was to the prophet Muhammad in the seventh century. The central demand of Muslims (submitters) is submission to the will of Allah.</h2>
